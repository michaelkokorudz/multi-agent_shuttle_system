# Multi-Agent Shuttle System

This project develops an optimized shuttle system for Queen’s University students using **multi-agent systems** and **Lloyd's Algorithm**. It addresses transportation inefficiencies caused by harsh winters, long walking distances, and insufficient public transit, offering a safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly solution.

## Problem Statement

Queen’s University students face significant challenges commuting during winter:
- Harsh weather conditions make walking long distances unsafe.
- Public transit systems are often unreliable and inefficient.
- Increased reliance on private vehicles leads to traffic congestion and environmental harm.

### **Goals**
- Provide safe and efficient transportation.
- Reduce environmental impact by limiting private vehicle use.
- Enhance accessibility for all students.

## Features

### **1. Multi-Agent Simulation**
- Models shuttles as agents with:
  - **Observation range**: Determines areas the agent can monitor.
  - **Communication range**: Governs interaction with other agents.
- Agents iteratively adjust positions to optimize coverage.

### **2. Density-Based Movement**
- Population hotspots are modeled using Gaussian density maps.
- Shuttles are attracted to high-density regions for maximum efficiency.

### **3. Real-Time Adjustments**
- Agents dynamically adapt to changes in density and communication networks.

### **4. Visualization**
- Animates shuttle movements, communication links, and population densities.
- Provides insights into system behavior over time.
